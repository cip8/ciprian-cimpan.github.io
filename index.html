									<li>As my grandfather was a lorry 🚛 driver, I grew near heavy machinery which always broke and had to be fixed by mechanics. 🛠 This fascinated me: as a kid I spent whole days watching them work and come with ingenious workarounds due to lack of proper funding.</li>
									<li>I kept the passion of seeing how things work throughout my life: I often take things appart and repair them.</li>

							<h1>Case Study: <span>Luminate Group</span></h1>
							<div class="flex f-wrap">
								<p>Most of my work is for commercial enterprises, but recently I've had the privilege to work for Luminate Group. They are a global philanthropic organisation with the goal of empowering people and institutions to work together to build just and fair societies.</p>
								<p>Created by Pierre Omidyar (eBay's founder), the foundation has ambitious goals which are closely related to the real world in which we live today: data & privacy concerns, media rights in illiberal democracies, the fight for more transparent governments and many other concerning issues.</p>
								<p>They wanted to establish a bold online presence and at the same time have an easy way to manage grants, users, media and other content.</p>
								<p>I achieved this by developing a content management system with a back-end focused on simplicity and tailored to their exact needs. With built-in features like a blog, media library, seo edits & elastic search content indexing, the whole app is engineered to deliver content fast and with minimum editorial effort.</p>
								<p>With a very tight deadline and pressure building up before the launch date - the site was streamed live on a video-wall at a fundraising party - I completed the project on time and above client expectations.</p>
								<p>Pleased with the results, Luminate contracted us for a second development phase, in which the CMS will get upgraded with multi-language support, an improved grants management interface and other useful features.</p>
								<p>Working for a NGO that is focused on improving the world we live in was a nice experience and I was proud to help them move one step closer to achieving their goals.</p>

							<h1>Case Study: <span>PDF Generation Tool</span></h1>
							<div class="flex f-wrap">
								<div class="main">
									<p>One of Zaang's key service is to compile UX reports for existing or prospective clients.</p>
									<p>In this process, a large share of time is lost formatting the raport - collating screenshots and presenting content nicely. Most comprehensive reports have over 100 pages and required expensive subscription-based software (Adobe InDesign) to layout properly and export.</p>
									<p>My task was to create a tool that can be used by Zaang and other UX companies to compile reports in a much faster, cheaper and efficient manner.</p>
									<p>Using off-the-shelf PDF generation libraries was slow and put high pressure on the server for large documents, so we had to pivot away from traditional methods and use modern technologies such as Puppeteer and Google Chrome running in headless mode.</p>

									<li>I'd like to shift my focus from agency / multi-client work to a single product that can be upgraded and improved continuously.</li>
									<li>Oaky builds services that directly impacts peoples' lives, bringing extra value both to hoteliers and their guests.</li>

									<li>Besides the reasons related to your product and technology around it, I also like the energy around your company. The multi-cultural environment that Oaky promotes and your efforts to build a resilient and tight-knit team is something I subscribe to.</li>
