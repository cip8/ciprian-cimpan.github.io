It was really nice meeting you. 

Both Fotis and me are positive there is a good fit with Oaky on a personal and professional level. Next step is a presentation for the other two co-founders: Erik and Lars. 

Please prepare a personal presentation with slides that cover at least the following:

-Â Personal background
- professional background and ambition
- Why Oaky?
- Why you?

Can you also make it this Wednesday at 1600? 
Looking forward to see you on Wednesday!
